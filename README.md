# Introduction
This is a micro benchmark for HSA platform.

#Execute
1. Run `run.sh` in dir.

#Problem
* There are still some problem needed to be fixed.
1. Why global_ld & const_ld cannot execute successfully.(Both ISA are the same)
2. Why speed of global,local,private,const.(HSA runtime dosn't support private segment yet)
3. local_ld problems.(fixed)

#Result
